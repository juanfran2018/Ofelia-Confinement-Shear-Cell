# Ofelia Confinement Shear Cell

## Motivation

Nowadays, a significant research effort is devoted to aqueous lubrication [1]. 
Nature overcomes the poor lubricity of water by modifying the sheared surfaces 
with biological molecules. In the search for key components of biological lubricants, 
long glycoproteins like mucins seem to be a cornerstone [2]. While it has been 
proposed that this type of molecules provide efficient boundary lubrication due 
to a combination of entropic and hydration lubrication effects [2], 
the underlying molecular mechanisms are far from being understood. 
Specifically, little is known on the structure of confined mucin films. 
In this regard, Neutron Reflectometry (NR) is a promising tool for 
extracting thin film structural information of boundary lubricant 
films under confinement and shear. Recently, a team partly formed 
by the applicants developed a sample environment for NR studies 
of mechanically confined thin soft films [3]. In this setup (Fig. 1), 
a flexible membrane (Melinex 401) that can conform to long range 
waviness or bend around any entrained dust is inflated against 
a solid hard surface. This setup has been successfully used 
for several NR studies at ILL [3-6].
