# Ofelia Confinement Shear Cell

## Motivation
<div style="text-align: right"> 
The solvent-mediated forces between macromolecular structures at
surfaces are the essence of the physics of adhesion, 
lubrication and many other applications in particle aggregation and coalescence. Surface force apparatus (1970)
and Atomic Force Microscopy have revealed as very useful tools to characterize
the interactions between surfaces. However , in these direct force measurements, 
the structures of the interacting media are not known in detail, 
particularly as the surfaces are compressed or confined. 

In this sense, Neutron Reflection (NR) is a powerful technique to study the structure of thin films at interfaces. 
The development of an instrument capable of measuring confined samples has a long history. The initial approach 
(Crossgrove and Zarbakhsh, 1994) was bring two solid surfaces together, with two quartz blocks providing they are parallel surfaces 
and a hydraulic pressure system used to bring the surfaces to within 10-100 nm of each other. 
The pressure required was large (10-150 bar), and strongly dependent of the sample. Other approaches  
(Kuhl and coworkers, 2001) also developed a similar confinement cell for neutron reflectometry with a limit
of 80 to 100 nm for the smallest distance between surfaces. This approach also has the possibility to apply steady shear rates from 0.001 to 20 Hz (faster with oscillatory motion). Both
approaches have similar problems: solid surface approach can be limited by any dust present between substrates, 
affecting the pressure distribution across the surfaces; the inherent long range waviness of substrates 
play also a limiting role in the minimum distance between surfaces.

An original approach (Bristol University, 2012) to this problem was able to solve nearly all these problems. 
Using a flexible membrane, Melinex (Polyethylene Terephtalate, DuPont Teijin) as one of the substrates, avoids
the nearly all problems with dust particles and solves the lack of flatness of the surfaces over large interfacial areas and provides
close an even molecular contact between interfaces over a large area.

This setup has been successfully used at a number of studies at ILL and ISIS. 
Within the framework of a collaborative project between Malm√∂ University, 
Kent University, ISIS, ESS and ILL recently funded by the Swedish Research Council 
and the Nordforsk Foundation, this confinement cell have been further developed , 
and implemented the possibility of shearing the opposing surfaces. 

The determination of the structures of sheared boundary lubricants remains a challenge, 
which results in a lack of understanding of boundary lubrication mechanisms severely 
impeding the rational design of lubricants. This is clear for the case of water based 
lubricants, for which we lack a mechanical understanding. Specifically, different types 
of hydrophilic polymer coatings (e.g., PEO brushes [8]) have been reported to provide 
extraordinary lubricating performance in aqueous solution. This is counterintuitive 
as these soft layers should significantly dissipate friction energy. The developed cell 
will allow this mechanistic understanding and, subsequently, 
the rational design of water based lubricants that could e.g., replace those based on oils.

In the new setup, shear has been implemented modifying the central support of the silicon block. Two
designs were developed for different types of shear:

* Rotational confinement shear cell

* Linear confinement shear cell

In the rotational design a bevel gear (5:1) has been introduced, thus, decoupling the normal force from the rotational movement. 
The transmission is mediated using a reducer gearbox (100:1) while the movement 
using a servo motor (Mitsubishi). The combined reduction factor of the gearbox and the bevel gear is 500:1. 
This setup allows us to apply relevant shear rates (1-1000s-1).
