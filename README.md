# Ofelia Confinement Shear Cell

## Motivation

The solvent-mediated forces between macromolecular structures at
surfaces are the essence of the physics of adhesion, 
lubrication and many other applications in particle aggregation and coalescence. Surface force apparatus (1970)
and Atomic Force Microscopy have revealed as very useful tools to characterize
the interactions between surfaces. However , in these direct force measurements, 
the structures of the interacting media are not known in detail, 
particularly as the surfaces are compressed or confined. 

In this sense, Neutron Reflection (NR) is a powerful technique to study the structure of thin films at interfaces. 
The development of an instrument capable of measuring confined samples has a long history. The initial approach 
(Crossgrove and Zarbakhsh) was bring two solid surfaces together, with two quartz blocks providing they are parallel surfaces 
and a hydraulic pressure system used to bring the surfaces to within 10-100 nm of each other. 
The pressure required was large (10-150 bar), and strongly dependent of the sample. Other approaches  
(Kuhl and coworkers) also developed a similar confinement cell for neutron reflectometry with a limit
of 80 to 100 nm for the smallest distance between surfaces. T
his approach also has the possibility to apply steady shear rates from 0.001 to 20 Hz (faster with oscillatory motion). Both
approaches have similar problems: solid surface approach can be limited by any dust present between substrates, 
affecting the pressure distribution across the surfaces; the inherent long range waviness of substrates 
play also a limiting role in the minimum distance between surfaces.

An original approach (Bristol University) to this problem was able to solve nearly all these problems. 
Using a flexible membrane, Melinex (Polyethylene Terephtalate, DuPont Teijin) as one of the substrates, avoids
the nearly all problems with dust particles and solves the lack of flatness of the surfaces over large interfacial areas and provides
close an even molecular contact between interfaces over a large area.
